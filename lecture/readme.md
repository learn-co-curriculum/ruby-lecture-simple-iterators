different kinds of loops but all essentially the same
while/until use comparisons to decide how long to run
for in iterates over a list but we don't use it
these three all have normal scope

upto, loop, times all have block scope

we can use break/next in all these loops/iterators


/////////merged two lectures

why are loops cool?
a script vs a program (programs run forever, scripts do some tasks and end)
programs that loop infinitely usually communicate with the outside world or have some way of changing their own state
what program do we use all the time that has a loop?
webserver
browser

allow us to do repetitive tasks for free
control flow
conditionals + loops we can represent many many ideas

go to ruby files
comparison operators
while
until

for in
no new scope, built into language

talk about scope? scope is like memory, its value is in forgetting
iterators/introduce block scope
times
upto
loop
 
next
break
